ASP.NET MVC related references are conditionally copy-local when compiling with the MonoDebug or MonoRelease build configurations.

AnimeRecs.Web.csproj has been manually modified to add project references, which Visual Web Developer Express does not normally allow you to do.

This change works when invoking msbuild on the command-line, but when building from Visual Web Developer external project references are not build. Instead, the build process skips building the referenced project looks at where the output would be.

To get around that, there is a prebuild step on AnimeRecs.Web that invokes msbuild on the project references if not building for a Mono configuration.

There is a yellow warning sign on the reference in Solution Explorer. It compiles fine. You will get Intellisense if you manually build the referenced projects in AnimeRecs.RecEngine.sln.
