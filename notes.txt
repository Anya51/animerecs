Yes, I know the plural of "anime" is "anime", not "animes". "animes" is used in the code because code clarity > grammatical correctness.

NLog 1 is used instead of NLog 2 because NLog 2 has serious issues on Mono on Linux. (http://nlog-project.org/2011/10/30/using-nlog-with-mono.html) Do not upgrade to NLog 2 unless you are certain that the issues have been fixed.
