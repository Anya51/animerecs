Critical
--------
Logging in the web app
Specific user error message for when a MAL id is not found.
More accurate status. "Completed but not rated" should not be "unwatched". Neither should anime that is currently being watched.

Major
-----
Remember username and cutoffs


Normal
------
Graceful degradation in absence of javascript
Don't send empty string for name - client-side validation of input

Minor
-----
Put anime name in MAL link, just like how MAL does it
