Critical
--------
Scale minimum number of recommendations in common with number of shows watched
Logging in the web app
More accurate status. "Completed but not rated" should not be "unwatched". Neither should anime that is currently being watched.


Major
-----
Remember username and cutoffs
Randomize order of recommendors with same compatibility rating
Specific user error message for when a MAL id is not found.
Bug that shows up in Firefox: Uncheck checkbox, refresh, checkbox is unchecked but no textboxes.


Normal
------
Graceful degradation in absence of javascript
Don't send empty string for name - client-side validation of input

Minor
-----
Put anime name in MAL link, just like how MAL does it
