Show-stopper
------------
Figure out mod_mono


Critical
--------
Top-level exception handler in the cache updater
Logging in the web app
Emit JSON error for server-side exceptions instead of default ASP.NET error
Detect server errors on client side, display some sort of message
Input fields for what scores to consider "liked" and "ok"
Make it not look ugly


Major
-----
Make recommendation fetching asynchronous
Display spinner or something while fetching recommendations
Show stats for liked, ok, disliked


Normal
------
Don't send empty string for name - client-side validation of input
Check validity of JSON from server on client side, emit debugging information if invalid and message to user
Graceful degradation in absence of javascript
Sort recommendors and recommendations client-side. The server is not guranteed to return them in any order, it just happens to do so right now.

Minor
-----
ToString for various things for easier debugging
Allow recommendors' names to not be their real MAL names
Automate compilation of Dart code.
