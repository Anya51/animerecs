Critical
--------
Make it not look ugly
Message if user has not watched enough anime to have good recommendations
Show stats for liked, ok, disliked



Major
-----
Logging in the web app
Remember username and cutoffs
Ensure caching of static things like images and js
Remove unused default MVC junk
Don't send empty string for name - client-side validation of input


Normal
------
Return recommendations as html to assist in easier...
Graceful degradation in absence of javascript
Script for removing unneeded files from a publish
Sanitize username when creating link to MAL profile

Minor

Automate compilation of Dart code.
Put anime name in MAL link, just like how MAL does it
Better error messages in cache updater
Sort recommendors and recommendations client-side. The server is not guranteed to return them in any order, it just happens to do so right now.
