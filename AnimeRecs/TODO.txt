Show-stopper
------------
Figure out mod_mono


Critical
--------
Detect server errors on client side, display some sort of message
Make it not look ugly
Only allow one fetch of a given user's anime list at a time to help prevent DoS attacks
Message if user has not watched enough anime to have good recommendations


Major
-----
Make recommendation fetching asynchronous
Display spinner or something while fetching recommendations
Show stats for liked, ok, disliked
Emit JSON error for server-side exceptions instead of default ASP.NET error
Logging in the web app
Remember username and cutoffs


Normal
------
Don't send empty string for name - client-side validation of input
Check validity of JSON from server on client side, emit debugging information if invalid and message to user
Graceful degradation in absence of javascript
Sort recommendors and recommendations client-side. The server is not guranteed to return them in any order, it just happens to do so right now.

Minor
-----
Allow recommendors' names to not be their real MAL names
Automate compilation of Dart code.
Put anime name in MAL link, just like how MAL does it
Better error messages in cache updater
