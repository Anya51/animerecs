Critical
--------
Logging in the web app
Specific user error message for when a MAL id is not found.
More accurate status. "Completed but not rated" should not be "unwatched". Neither should anime that is currently being watched.
Uncheck checkbox, refresh, checkbox is unchecked but no textboxes.

Major
-----
Remember username and cutoffs


Normal
------
Graceful degradation in absence of javascript
Don't send empty string for name - client-side validation of input

Minor
-----
Put anime name in MAL link, just like how MAL does it
